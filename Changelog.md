# Introduction

This file lists the history of changes made to the repository
in a more wordy fashion of what this was about as an addition
to descriptive commit messages.


## Update 0.001

Affected versions
  Slang-Tools 1.4, Slang-JavaScript 1.2, Slang-Tools-Tests 1.1

Is a highly expiremental and work in progress status update.
Production use or any other use besides looking around at it
and giving feedback to the "author" is discuraged. The VMMaker
extracted SlangTest and partially removed testcases now pass.
Which means that some of the basic functionality in the C
related part of Slang code generation works as it was intended
in VMMaker.

Adds this Changelog file and the other initial commits and
references of base packages. So some of the initial work
of refactoring slang to a package was achieved successfully,
yeah?!
