# Project journal

This file is intended to record the history of this project. So that
when it get's abandoned people can take it up again from where it was
left off. The rule of the structure is that newest is at top, oldest
entry is at the bottom. And people mention the author of the entry
by his shortcut. Also people add their shortcuts to the list of
authors at the end of the file.
